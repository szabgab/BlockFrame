library is supposed to be based around session control.

```python
import chunky

#the module is used as an object to overarch the other 2 classes
chunker = chunky.Chunky(config.Config)

#the chunky file includes the other classes as reference, need to figure out to reference other classes through one
chunker.Chunker()



```
